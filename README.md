# Dog Party
<br />
<hr />
## This is where you will find the project overview for Lacy Rudd's dog-party 2.0
<hr />
## The Goal: To create two different CSS Style Sheets that look exactly like to comps provided using only one HTML sheet.
<hr />
### Project Description of What I Learned: I did not fully understand the heirarchy of HTML elements until a review session with an upper 3 mod of Friday Morning. Had I recieved this deeper understanding sooner, I would have had more time to re-write and redo a lot of my HTML and Style Sheets but feel grateful that while it may not show in my code currently, I do have a deeper understanding of how the heirarchy of this works and how to wireframe.
